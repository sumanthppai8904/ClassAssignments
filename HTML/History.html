      <h1>History of Bugatti</h1>
      <h2><u>Bugatti Description:</u></h2>
      <p>Automobiles Ettore Bugatti, an ace manufacturer of high-performance cars, was founded in 1909 by Ettore Bugatti. Bugatti cars have always been recognized for their extraordinarily beautiful designs, and for the huge number of races they won. Ettore Bugatti died in 1947, which brought the Bugatti marque to an end since his son had passed away in 1939, hence, there wasn't a successor to the lineage of Bugatti cars. At the time of Bugatti's death, only 8000 Bugatti cars had been made. The company released its one last model in the 1950s, and was then purchased for its airplane parts business. However, an Italian entrepreneur revived it as a builder of limited production exclusive sports cars in 1987. Now, the company is owned by the Volkswagen group. What makes Bugatti cars in India such a huge hit, and in fact in other international markets too, is the fact that Bugatti cars bring together exclusivity, luxury, elegance, style, extraordinary design, and the passion for automobiles. Furthermore, Bugatti's futuristic vision, an impressive legacy of legendary sports cars, and the revolutionary engineering in development, construction, and manufacture have helped this outstanding automotive brand carve its own niche. The independent character of Bugatti cars is reflected in the brand's logo: the pearl-framed oval sporting 60 pearls, the stylized initials of the brand’s founder, and the simple Bugatti word mark have adorned each Bugatti model since 1909. The logo embodies the official statement and the tradition-conscious promise that Bugatti offers its discerning customers.<br>
         The company distributes Bugatti cars in India via their Indian dealer Exclusive Motors, which is located in the nation's capital city, i.e. New Delhi, India. The company is also credited with raising the benchmark for luxury cars in India by launching the super premium sports car Bugatti Veyron 16.4 Grand Sport. This Bugatti car, a masterpiece of its own accord, the fastest production car in the world with legal road speed limits was first introduced in 2005. However, it did not reach India until 2011. Its starting price is Rs 16 crore, and is the most expensive car to hit the Indian roads. The history of this legendary brand and its two formative designers and engineers, i.e. Ettore Bugatti and his son, Jean Bugatti, goes far beyond technology and art – it is also a history of automotive pioneering. And this legacy lives on in the Veyron. </p>
